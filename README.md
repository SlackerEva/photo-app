# photo-app
Application for obtaining the title images of sites

### 1) Functional purpose

The Application was cretaed for collecting photos of the main web pages.

**My own task**

I have created this app for another project of mine.<br>
I had a list of sites which I needed to take photos of. After the photos had been made I transfered them to my other project.

### 2) Applied technology

JS, Node.js, puppetter, fs

### 3) Input data and how to run the project

Download the repository on your local machine after that install the modules (npm i) in the project terminal and run it by using ‘node index.js’.

#### For running the app with your data:

Clear the file "log.csv" and the folder "images", put the file with the list of the sites in the root folder. Write down the name of your file in the file "index.js" and run the app. <br>

Pay attention to the correct filling of the file.

### 4) Disadvantages and future updates:

For now the photos a made with pop-ups.
